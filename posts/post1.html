                <p>GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.</p>
                
                <p>You can host your site on GitHub's github.io domain or your own custom domain. And unlike other hosting services, GitHub Pages is completely free.</p>
                
                <p>To get started with GitHub Pages, you'll need a GitHub account and a repository to host your site. If you're new to Git or GitHub, don't worry - the process is straightforward.</p>
                
                <p>Here's a step-by-step guide:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a new repository or use an existing one</li>
                    <li>Add your website files to the repository</li>
                    <li>Go to the repository settings</li>
                    <li>Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section</li>
                    <li>Select the branch you want to publish</li>
                    <li>Click Save</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>That's it! Your site will be published at https://username.github.io/repository or your custom domain if you've set one up.</p>
                
                <p>In the next post, we'll look at how to customize your GitHub Pages site with themes and layouts.</p>
